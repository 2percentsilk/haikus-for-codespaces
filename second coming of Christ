What about God's covenant with Israel? Isn't God faithful to his promise to Israel.....
for instance that David's throne would be estalished forever? 
Amillennialists believe that the church---the true Israel---will fulfill these promise.
Paul and John state that believers in Christ are Abraham's seed---the Jews and --therefore heirs of God's promises
(Revelation 2-9 and vs 3-9)
