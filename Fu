Installing gh on Linux and BSD
Packages downloaded from https://cli.github.com or from https://github.com/cli/cli/releases are considered official binaries. We focus on popular Linux distros and the following CPU architectures: i386, amd64, arm64, armhf.

Other sources for installation are community-maintained and thus might lag behind our release schedule.

curl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | sudo dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg

Manual installation
Download release binaries that match your platform; or
Build from source.
Unofficial, community-supported methods
The GitHub CLI team does not maintain the following packages or repositories and thus we are unable to provide support for those installation methods.

Snap (do not use)
There are so many issues with Snap as a runtime mechanism for apps like GitHub CLI that our team suggests never installing gh as a snap.

Arch Linux
Arch Linux users can install from the community repo:

sudo pacman -S github-cli
Alternatively, use the unofficial AUR package to build GitHub CLI from source.

Android
Android 7+ users can install via Termux:

pkg install gh
FreeBSD
FreeBSD users can install from the ports collection:

cd /usr/ports/devel/gh/ && make install clean
Or via pkg(8):

pkg install gh
NetBSD/pkgsrc
NetBSD users and those on platforms supported by pkgsrc can install the gh package:

pkgin install gh
To install from source:

cd /usr/pkgsrc/net/gh && make package-install
OpenBSD
In -current, or in releases starting from 7.0, OpenBSD users can install from packages:

pkg_add github-cli
Funtoo
Funtoo Linux has an autogenerated github-cli package, located in dev-kit, which can be installed in the following way:

emerge -av github-cli
Upgrading can be done by syncing the repos and then requesting an upgrade:

ego sync
emerge -u github-cli
Gentoo
Gentoo Linux users can install from the main portage tree:

emerge -av github-cli
Upgrading can be done by updating the portage tree and then requesting an upgrade:

emerge --sync
emerge -u github-cli
Kiss Linux
Kiss Linux users can install from the community repos:

kiss b github-cli && kiss i github-cli
Nix/NixOS
